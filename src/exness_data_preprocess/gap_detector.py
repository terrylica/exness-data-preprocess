"""
Gap detection for incremental database updates.

SLOs:
- Availability: Gap detection must succeed or raise exception (no silent failures)
- Correctness: Detects all missing months from start_date to current month
- Observability: All gap detection operations logged via print statements
- Maintainability: Single module for all gap detection logic, off-the-shelf DuckDB

Handles:
- New database initialization (no existing data)
- Empty database detection (tables exist but no ticks)
- Gap detection before earliest and after latest coverage
- Month enumeration from start_date to current month
