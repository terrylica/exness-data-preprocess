## Key Findings

### 1. Weekend Gap Behavior
- ✅ **No trading on Saturday** (entire day gap as expected)
- ✅ **Forex reopens Sunday 22:00 UTC** (matches industry standard)
- ✅ **~48 hour gap** from Friday close to Sunday reopen

### 2. Timezone-Aware Session Detection
- ✅ **Western exchanges correctly show 0 flags on Sunday** (it's Sunday in their local time)
- ✅ **Asian/Oceanic exchanges correctly show 1 flags on Sunday evening UTC** (it's Monday morning in their local time)
- ✅ **Exchange-specific trading hours respected** (Tokyo at 07:05 JST shows flag=0 because market doesn't open until 09:00)

### 3. New Zealand First to Open
- ✅ **NZX is the first exchange to open after the weekend** (Monday 10:00 NZST = Sunday 21:00 UTC)
- ✅ Database correctly shows NZX flag=1 starting at Sunday 22:05 UTC

### 4. Staggered Monday Openings
As Monday progresses in UTC (Sunday evening → Monday morning UTC), exchanges light up sequentially:
1. **New Zealand** opens first (Sunday 21:00 UTC = Monday 10:00 NZST)
2. **Australia** opens next (Sunday 23:00 UTC = Monday 10:00 AEDT)
3. **Tokyo** opens later (Monday 00:00 UTC = Monday 09:00 JST)
4. **Hong Kong/Singapore** open after (Monday 01:30 UTC = Monday 09:30/09:00 local)
5. **Europe** opens much later (Monday 08:00 UTC = Monday 09:00 CET)
6. **US** opens last (Monday 14:30 UTC = Monday 09:30 EST)

## Conclusion

Weekend gap detection works correctly with `exchange_calendars`:
- Forex market behavior matches industry standard (48-hour weekend gap)
- Session flags correctly reflect LOCAL timezone trading hours
- No false positives during weekends for Western exchanges
- Asian/Oceanic exchanges correctly detect Monday morning sessions even though it's Sunday in UTC

**Implementation**: session_detector.py correctly delegates to `exchange_calendars.is_open_on_minute()` which handles all timezone conversions automatically.
