# Final Recommendations: ML Feature Engineering

**Based on**: Modal-band-excluded variance estimation and hurdle model analysis
**Decision Framework**: Signal Quality Score maximization
**Target Application**: ML-based microstructure modeling and HFT signal extraction

---

## Executive Recommendation

### ✅ USE: Standard (EURUSD)

**Signal Quality Score: 26.57** (highest among all variants)

**Formal Reasoning**:

> In mode-truncated analysis, Standard (EURUSD) exhibits the highest proportion of non-deterministic observations (22.5%) with extreme coefficient of variation (118.1%). This yields a signal quality score 31.6× superior to Raw_Spread and 34× superior to Mini/Cent variants, providing optimal microstructure information for ML feature engineering.

| Variant      | Modal %     | Non-Modal %  | CV_truncated | Signal Score | **Recommendation**    |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | --------------------- |
| **Standard** | 77.5%       | **22.5%**    | **118.1%**   | **26.57**    | ✅ **PRIMARY CHOICE** |
| Mini         | 98.4%       | 1.6%         | 48.9%        | 0.78         | ❌ Reject             |

## 2. Standard (EURUSD): Technical Justification

### Microstructure Characteristics

**Modal Regime** (77.5% of observations):

- Base spread: 0.56 pips
- Represents normal market conditions
- Tight bid-ask (low transaction cost regime)

**Non-Modal Regime** (22.5% of observations):

- Mean spread: 0.95 pips
- Std dev: 1.12 pips
- **CV: 118.1%** (extreme variability)
- Range: 0.69p → 13.4p

**CV Interpretation Note**: The 118.1% CV is driven by tail outliers (P95-P99.9: 3.68-13.4 pips) rather than uniform variability. The non-modal distribution exhibits secondary clustering at 0.69 pips (P1-P90), indicating bimodal structure. This CV reflects outlier sensitivity, making it suitable for detecting rare extreme spread events. See Methodology §6 Limitations for multimodal considerations.

**Regime Transitions**:

- Frequent switching (22.5% excursion rate)
- High variance during excursions
- Rich information for regime detection

### ML Engineering Advantages

1. **Sufficient Variance Mass** (22.5%)
   - 881,837 varying observations
   - Adequate training data for variance-based models
   - Supports robust statistical learning

2. **Extreme Mode-Truncated CV** (118%)
   - Captures regime-switching dynamics
   - Enables discrimination between spread states
   - High feature information content

3. **Realistic Spread Behavior**
   - No artificial zero-inflation
   - Authentic market microstructure
   - Generalizable to real trading conditions

4. **Signal-to-Static Ratio**
   - 22.5% signal / 77.5% static = 0.29
   - Higher than Mini/Cent (1.6/98.4 = 0.016)
   - 18× better information density

### Recommended Use Cases

✅ **Optimal Applications**:

- **Regime-switching models**: HMM, MS-GARCH for spread forecasting
- **HFT signal extraction**: Spread anomaly detection
- **Market microstructure analysis**: Order flow imbalance, liquidity modeling
- **ML feature engineering**: Spread variance as predictive feature
- **Transaction cost modeling**: Dynamic spread forecasting

✅ **Feature Engineering Strategies**:

- Rolling mode-truncated CV (window-based regime detection)
- Spread excursion indicators (binary: in-mode vs out-of-mode)
- Non-modal spread percentiles (P75, P90, P99 as risk metrics)
- Regime transition probabilities (Markov switching)

---

## 3. Why Reject Mini/Cent

### Technical Limitations

**Ultra-High Modal Concentration** (98.4%):

- Only 1.6% of observations vary (57,746 ticks)
- Insufficient variance mass for ML training
- Near-deterministic behavior

**Low Mode-Truncated CV** (48.9%):

- 2.4× lower than Standard (118% outlier-driven CV)
- Minimal spread dynamics even in non-modal tail
- Poor feature discrimination

**Signal Quality Score** (0.78):

- 34× inferior to Standard
- Unusable for variance-based modeling

### Microstructure Issues

**Sparse Regime Transitions**:

- 98.4% in single regime (0.89p mode)
- 1.6% excursion rate (too rare)
- Insufficient regime information

**Ineffective for ML**:

- Training on 98.4% static data = poor generalization
- 1.6% varying data = overfitting risk
- Regime detection models degrade to constant prediction

### Alternative Use Cases (Non-ML)

⚠️ **Limited Applications**:

- Static transaction cost estimation (use mode as base cost)
- Deterministic spread modeling (if variance is undesired)
- Account-type comparison (Mini vs Cent identical, naming difference only)

---

## 4. Why Reject Raw_Spread

### Extreme Zero-Inflation (98.3%)

**Hurdle Model Decomposition**:

- 98.3% deterministic zeros
- 1.7% positive tail
- Final varying mass: **1.4%** (after mode exclusion)

**Signal Quality Score** (0.84):

- 32× inferior to Standard
- Unusable for ML feature extraction

### Artificial Construction

**Zero-Spread Regime**:

- 98.3% zero spreads not realistic for FX market
- Likely synthetic/post-processed data
- Does not reflect true bid-ask dynamics

**Positive Tail**:

- Sparse observations (22,278 ticks)
- Mean 3.12p (higher than Standard)
- Represents exceptional events, not normal conditions

### Microstructure Implications

**Unsuitable for**:

- ❌ Realistic spread modeling
- ❌ Transaction cost analysis
- ❌ Liquidity research
- ❌ ML feature engineering

**Why it fails**:

- Zeros mask true microstructure
- Positive tail too sparse for robust estimation
- Mode-truncated CV (58.6%) lower than Standard despite appearance

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

### Feature Engineering with Standard (EURUSD)

#### 1. Binary Regime Indicator

```python
# Define regime based on mode-truncation
mode_value = 0.56  # From analysis
df['regime'] = (df['spread'] != mode_value).astype(int)
# 0 = in-mode (static), 1 = excursion (varying)
```

#### 2. Mode-Truncated Rolling CV

```python
# Calculate rolling CV excluding mode
window = 100  # ticks
df['rolling_cv_truncated'] = df['spread'].rolling(window).apply(
    lambda x: (x[x != mode_value].std() / x[x != mode_value].mean()) * 100
    if len(x[x != mode_value]) > 0 else 0
)
```

#### 3. Excursion Percentile Features

```python
# Non-modal spread percentiles
non_modal = df[df['spread'] != mode_value]['spread']
df['p90_excursion'] = non_modal.rolling(window).quantile(0.90)
df['p99_excursion'] = non_modal.rolling(window).quantile(0.99)
```

#### 4. Regime Transition Probability

```python
# Markov transition matrix
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
regime_transitions = pd.crosstab(
    df['regime'].shift(1),
    df['regime'],
    normalize='index'
)
# P(excursion | in-mode) = transition probability
```

### Model Selection by Use Case

| Use Case                          | Recommended Model      | Feature Set                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Spread Forecasting**            | MS-GARCH, HMM          | Rolling CV, regime indicator                |
| **HFT Signal Detection**          | Isolation Forest, LSTM | Excursion percentiles, CV anomalies         |
| **Liquidity Modeling**            | Random Forest          | Mode%, non-modal variance, transitions      |
| **Transaction Cost Optimization** | XGBoost                | Mode value, P90/P99 excursions, regime prob |

---

## 6. Validation Criteria

### Model Performance Metrics

**For Regime Detection Models**:

- Precision/Recall on excursion regime (target: >80%)
- F1-score on binary regime classification
- AUC-ROC for regime probability prediction

**For Spread Forecasting**:

- RMSE on non-modal spreads (exclude mode from test set)
- MAE weighted by regime (higher weight on excursions)
- Directional accuracy (spread widening/tightening)

### Signal Quality Monitoring

**Production Metrics**:

- Monitor rolling mode-truncated CV (should match 118% historical)
- Track non-modal % (should maintain ~22.5%)
- Alert if modal concentration exceeds 85% (regime shift)

---

## 7. Alternative Scenarios

### If Standard is Unavailable

**Fallback Decision Tree**:

```
IF Standard unavailable:
    IF application = static spread modeling:
        USE Mini or Cent (mode as base cost)
    ELIF application = ML/variance-based:
        REJECT all variants
        REQUEST alternative data source
    ELSE:
        EVALUATE Standart_Plus (not analyzed, may have better signal)
```

### If Zero-Inflation is Required

**Synthetic Data Generation**:
If zero-spread modeling needed (e.g., maker-taker fee analysis):

1. Start with Standard (authentic dynamics)
2. Apply conditional zero-injection (P(zero) = target%)
3. Preserve non-zero distribution from Standard
4. Validate mode-truncated CV matches Standard
