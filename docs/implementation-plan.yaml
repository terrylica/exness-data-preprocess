slos:
  availability: "Pytest invocation must be available on demand; baseline test command exits successfully in >=0.99 of scheduled runs per reporting period."
  correctness: "Baseline pytest suite must pass without alterations; any failure blocks promotion until resolved."
  observability: "Capture pytest stdout/stderr and exit status; raise errors immediately on non-zero exit."
  maintainability: "Update this plan file on every lifecycle change; prune deprecated steps before adding new ones."
constraints:
  - "On any error, raise and propagateâ€”no fallbacks, defaults, retries, or silent handling."
  - "Use out-of-the-box or off-the-shelf tooling; avoid custom implementations."
