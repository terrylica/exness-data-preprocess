# CLAUDE.md Reorganization - Verification Checklist

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Purpose**: Verify content exists elsewhere BEFORE removing from CLAUDE.md
**Principle**: Single source of truth - only remove if documented elsewhere with same detail level

---

## Verification Methodology

For each section in CLAUDE.md:

1. **Identify content** - What information is in this section?
2. **Search for alternatives** - Where else might this content exist?
3. **Verify detail level** - Does alternative have SAME level of detail?
4. **Decision**:
   - ✅ **REMOVE**: Content exists elsewhere with same detail → Replace with link
   - ⏳ **CREATE THEN REMOVE**: Content doesn't exist → Create new file, then link
   - ❌ **KEEP**: Content is essential for AI assistant → Keep in CLAUDE.md

---

## Section 1: Header (Lines 1-9)

### Content

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code...
**Architecture**: Professional forex tick data preprocessing...
**Full Documentation**: README.md
```

### Verification

- ❌ **Essential metadata** - Keep as-is
- Purpose statement needed for AI assistant context

### Decision

- ✅ **KEEP** - Essential header

---

## Section 2: Development Commands (Lines 11-65)

### Content

- Setup commands (uv sync, pip install)
- Testing commands (pytest, coverage)
- Code quality commands (ruff, mypy)
- Building and publishing commands (uv build, doppler)

### Verification

- Check README.md for these commands
- Check CONTRIBUTING.md for development workflow

### Search Plan

```bash
grep -n "uv sync" README.md CONTRIBUTING.md
grep -n "pytest" README.md CONTRIBUTING.md
grep -n "ruff format" README.md CONTRIBUTING.md
```

### Decision

- ⏳ **PENDING VERIFICATION**

---

## Section 3: Module Structure (Lines 71-157)

### Content

**Detailed module descriptions including**:

- Absolute file paths (e.g., `/Users/terryli/eon/exness-data-preprocess/src/exness_data_preprocess/processor.py`)
- Line number references (e.g., "Lines 76-110: **init**()")
- Specific SLOs (e.g., "Availability (raise on failure), Correctness (URL patterns)")
- Class names (e.g., `ExnessDownloader`, `TickLoader`, `DatabaseManager`)
- Method signatures (e.g., `download_zip(year, month, pair, variant)`)

**Example (downloader.py)**:

```markdown
2. **`downloader.py`** - HTTP download operations
   - **Responsibility**: Download Exness ZIP files from ticks.ex2archive.com
   - **SLOs**: Availability (raise on failure), Correctness (URL patterns),
     Observability (logging), Maintainability (httpx library)
   - **Class**: `ExnessDownloader`
   - **Methods**: `download_zip(year, month, pair, variant)`
```

### Verification Required

1. **Check docs/README.md** - Module architecture section
2. **Search for SLO details** - Does ANY file contain specific SLO descriptions?
3. **Search for class names** - Are class names documented elsewhere?
4. **Search for method signatures** - Are method signatures documented elsewhere?

### Search Plan

```bash
# Check if docs/README.md has module details
grep -A 5 "downloader.py" docs/README.md

# Check if any file has SLO descriptions
grep -r "Availability (raise on failure)" docs/

# Check if class names are documented
grep -r "ExnessDownloader" docs/ README.md

# Check if method signatures are documented
grep -r "download_zip(year, month, pair, variant)" docs/ README.md
```

### Decision

- ⏳ **PENDING VERIFICATION** - This is the CRITICAL section that was removed incorrectly last time

## Section 13: References (Lines 466-472)

### Content

- External links (Exness, DuckDB, Parquet, Zstd)

### Analysis

- External links are essential and won't exist in other project docs
- Should keep

### Decision

- ✅ **KEEP** - External references

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run all verification searches** - Execute grep commands above
2. **Document findings** - For each section, record:
   - ✅ Content exists elsewhere (safe to remove/link)
   - ❌ Content does NOT exist elsewhere (must keep or create)
   - ⚠️ Partial match (need to enhance existing doc first)
3. **Create reorganization plan** - Based on verification results
4. **Get user approval** - Present plan before making changes
5. **Implement changes** - Only after verification and approval

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid (Lessons Learned)

❌ **Don't**:

- Assume content exists elsewhere without verifying
- Remove detailed SLO information without checking
- Remove class names and method signatures without verifying
- Use absolute file paths (violates portability)
- Include line numbers (volatile, changes with code)

✅ **Do**:

- Verify BEFORE removing (grep, read files)
- Check detail level matches (not just topic exists)
- Create new docs if content doesn't exist elsewhere
- Link to introspection commands (e.g., `make module-stats`)
- Ask user if uncertain about what's "essential"

**Status**: Verification checklist created, searches pending
**Next**: Execute verification searches for each section
