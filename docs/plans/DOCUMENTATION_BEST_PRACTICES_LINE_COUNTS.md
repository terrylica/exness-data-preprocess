# Documentation Best Practices: Avoiding Line Count References

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Source**: Web research + industry best practices
**Context**: Preventing stale documentation from line count drift

---

## Problem Statement

**Issue**: Documentation that mentions line counts becomes stale immediately:

- Code formatting changes line counts (ruff, black)
- Adding comments increases line counts
- Refactoring changes line counts
- Creates maintenance burden (78% of dev teams report challenges with outdated docs - Stack Overflow 2024)

**Example from This Project**:

```markdown
❌ BAD: "api.py - 267 lines"
✅ Reality 2 days later: api.py is 290 lines
```

---

## Industry Best Practices (2024-2025)

### 1. **Avoid Volatile Implementation Details**

**Principle**: "Documentation should leave out unnecessary details that don't add value, including minor implementation details" (Archbee, 2024)

**What NOT to Document**:

- ❌ Line counts
- ❌ File sizes in bytes/KB
- ❌ Number of functions/classes (changes with refactoring)
- ❌ Temporary workarounds
- ❌ Deprecated code paths

**What TO Document**:

- ✅ Module purpose and responsibility
- ✅ Architecture patterns (facade, observer, etc.)
- ✅ SLOs (availability, correctness, observability, maintainability)
- ✅ Dependencies and relationships
- ✅ Public API contracts

---

### 2. **Living Documentation Pattern**

**Definition**: "Dynamic, self-updating content that evolves alongside your codebase, automatically synchronizing with code changes" (CodeLucky, 2025)

**Implementation Strategies**:

#### A. **Self-Documenting Code** (Preferred)

```python
# ❌ BAD: Stale comment
# This module is 267 lines and handles 5 API functions

# ✅ GOOD: Self-documenting structure
"""
Backward compatibility API for v1.0.0 CLI commands.

Maps v1.0.0 monthly-file API to v2.0.0 unified single-file architecture.

**Functions**:
- process_month() - Process single month
- process_date_range() - Process date range
- query_ohlc() - Query OHLC data
- analyze_ticks() - Analyze tick data
- get_storage_stats() - Get storage statistics
"""
# Line count: introspectable via `wc -l api.py`, no need to document
```

#### B. **Automated Documentation Generation**

```bash
# Generate documentation from code automatically
# - API docs: Swagger, Javadoc, Sphinx
# - Module structure: tree, cloc, tokei
# - Dependencies: pipdeptree, npm list

# Example: Generate module stats on-demand
cloc src/exness_data_preprocess/*.py --by-file --md
```

#### C. **CI/CD Integration**

```yaml
# Generate fresh documentation on every commit
- name: Generate docs
  run: |
    sphinx-build -b html docs/ docs/_build/
    # Documentation always reflects current code
```

---

### 3. **Focus on "Why" Not "What"**

**Principle**: "The metric to use is the amount of time spent looking for code within a file versus reading it" (Software Engineering Stack Exchange)

**Examples**:

```markdown
❌ BAD: "processor.py - 412 lines - Thin orchestrator facade"
Problem: Line count is volatile, adds no value

✅ GOOD: "processor.py - Thin orchestrator facade"
Why it's better: Describes architecture pattern, no volatile metrics

✅ EVEN BETTER: "processor.py - Facade pattern coordinating 7 specialized modules"
Why: Explains design intent and structure, immune to formatting changes
```

---

### 4. **Separation of Concerns Metric**

**Principle**: "LOC should be used as a supporting metric combined with complexity, maintainability, and defect metrics" (Code Quality Metrics, 2025)

**Better Alternatives to Line Counts**:

| Metric         | Purpose             | Volatility           | Value     |
| -------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| Line count     | ❌ Code size        | High (every format)  | Low       |
| Module count   | Module architecture | Medium (refactoring) | Medium    |
| Responsibility | Design clarity      | Low (rarely changes) | High      |
| Pattern        | Architecture intent | Very Low             | Very High |
| SLOs           | Service contract    | Very Low             | Very High |

**Example Transformation**:

```markdown
# ❌ BEFORE (volatile, low value)

**Specialized Modules**:

1. downloader.py - 82 lines - HTTP downloads
2. tick_loader.py - 67 lines - CSV parsing
3. database_manager.py - 208 lines - Database ops
4. session_detector.py - 121 lines - Session detection
5. gap_detector.py - 157 lines - Gap detection
6. ohlc_generator.py - 199 lines - OHLC generation
7. query_engine.py - 290 lines - Query operations

# ✅ AFTER (stable, high value)

**Specialized Modules**:

1. **downloader.py** - HTTP download operations
   - **SLOs**: Availability (raise on failure), Correctness (URL patterns)
   - **Pattern**: Thin wrapper around httpx library

2. **tick_loader.py** - CSV parsing
   - **SLOs**: Availability (raise on failure), Correctness (timestamp parsing)
   - **Pattern**: Static method returning pandas DataFrame

3. **database_manager.py** - Database operations
   - **SLOs**: Availability (raise on failure), Correctness (schema integrity)
   - **Responsibility**: Initialize DB, create schema, insert ticks with PRIMARY KEY deduplication

4. **session_detector.py** - Session and holiday detection
   - **SLOs**: Availability (raise on failure), Correctness (exchange calendars)
   - **Pattern**: Facade wrapping exchange_calendars library

5. **gap_detector.py** - Missing month discovery
   - **SLOs**: Availability (raise on failure), Correctness (gap detection)
   - **Responsibility**: Compare DB coverage vs available data

6. **ohlc_generator.py** - Phase7 OHLC generation
   - **SLOs**: Availability (raise on failure), Correctness (Phase7 schema)
   - **Responsibility**: Generate 30-column OHLC from dual-variant ticks

7. **query_engine.py** - Query operations
   - **SLOs**: Availability (raise on failure), Correctness (SQL queries)
   - **Responsibility**: Tick/OHLC queries, date filtering, on-demand resampling
```

---

### 5. **Introspection Over Documentation**

**Principle**: "Make the system self-describing rather than externally described"

**Implementation**:

````markdown
# ❌ BAD: Document line counts in markdown

Module line counts:

- processor.py: 412 lines
- api.py: 290 lines
- ...

# ✅ GOOD: Provide introspection command

To get current module sizes:

```bash
cd src/exness_data_preprocess && for f in *.py; do echo "$f: $(wc -l < "$f") lines"; done | sort
```
````

# ✅ EVEN BETTER: Add to Makefile/CI

```makefile
.PHONY: module-stats
module-stats:
	@cd src/exness_data_preprocess && \
	for f in *.py; do \
		echo "$f: $$(wc -l < "$$f") lines"; \
	done | sort
```

Then document:

```markdown
**Module Statistics**: Run `make module-stats` to see current line counts
```

````

---

### 6. **Regular Documentation Review Cycles**

**Principle**: "Teams should review and update documentation every 3-6 months" (NinjaOne, 2025)

**Automated Checks**:

```bash
# Add to CI/CD to catch stale metrics
#!/bin/bash
# check-doc-drift.sh

# Extract line count claims from docs
grep -E '\d+ lines' CLAUDE.md | while read claim; do
    # Extract filename and claimed line count
    file=$(echo "$claim" | grep -oP '[a-z_]+\.py')
    claimed=$(echo "$claim" | grep -oP '\d+')

    # Get actual line count
    actual=$(wc -l < "src/exness_data_preprocess/$file")

    # Warn if drift > 5%
    drift=$(( (actual - claimed) * 100 / claimed ))
    if [ $drift -gt 5 ] || [ $drift -lt -5 ]; then
        echo "WARNING: $file has $actual lines but docs claim $claimed (${drift}% drift)"
    fi
done
````

## Recommendations for This Project

### Immediate Actions

1. **Remove Line Count References** (30 minutes)
   - Replace with architecture patterns (facade, thin wrapper, etc.)
   - Replace with SLOs (availability, correctness, observability, maintainability)
   - Replace with responsibilities (what the module does)

2. **Add Introspection Commands** (15 minutes)

   ```bash
   # Add to Makefile or document in CONTRIBUTING.md
   make module-stats      # Show current line counts
   make module-complexity # Show cyclomatic complexity
   make module-deps       # Show dependencies
   ```

3. **Update Documentation Style Guide** (10 minutes)
   - Add: "Do not document line counts, file sizes, or other volatile metrics"
   - Add: "Focus on architecture patterns, SLOs, and responsibilities"
   - Add: "Provide introspection commands instead of hardcoded metrics"

### Long-Term Strategy

1. **Living Documentation** (2 hours initial setup)
   - Generate API docs from docstrings (Sphinx)
   - Auto-update on every commit (CI/CD)
   - Version documentation with code

2. **Automated Drift Detection** (1 hour)
   - CI check that fails if documentation mentions line counts
   - Pre-commit hook to warn about volatile metrics
   - Linter rule: "No numbers in architecture documentation"

3. **Focus on Value** (ongoing)
   - Document "why" not "what"
   - Describe patterns not implementations
   - Define contracts (SLOs) not sizes

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern                   | Problem                  | Better Alternative                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| "Module X is 412 lines"        | Changes with formatting  | "Module X uses facade pattern"            |
| "Function Y has 15 parameters" | Changes with refactoring | "Function Y coordinates multiple modules" |
| "File Z is 45KB"               | Changes with comments    | "File Z handles all OHLC generation"      |
| "Class A has 8 methods"        | Changes with extraction  | "Class A implements repository pattern"   |
| "Database is 2.08 GB"          | Changes constantly       | "Database stores 13 months of data"       |

## Examples from Industry

### Good: Rust Standard Library

```rust
/// A contiguous growable array type with heap-allocated contents.
///
/// Vectors have `O(1)` indexing, amortized `O(1)` push (to the end), and
/// `O(1)` pop (from the end).
```

- ✅ Describes behavior and complexity
- ✅ No mention of implementation size
- ✅ Focuses on contract and performance characteristics

### Good: Django Documentation

```python
"""
The ModelForm class maps a model to a form, using the model's field definitions
to automatically generate form fields with appropriate widgets and validation.

This eliminates repetitive code when creating forms that correspond to database models.
"""
```

- ✅ Describes purpose and benefit
- ✅ No mention of line count or size
- ✅ Explains the abstraction

### Bad: Legacy Documentation (Real Example)

```markdown
❌ "UserService.java - 1,247 lines - Handles all user operations"
```

- ❌ Line count becomes stale
- ❌ "All user operations" is vague
- ❌ No architectural guidance

---

## Implementation Learnings (2025-10-16)

### What We Did

**Scope**: Removed line count references from exness-data-preprocess v0.3.1 documentation

**Files Modified**:
1. CLAUDE.md (9 line count references removed)
2. docs/README.md (8 line count references removed)
3. RELEASE_NOTES.md (8 line count references removed)
4. CHANGELOG.md (8 line count references removed)
5. Makefile (NEW - introspection commands added)

**Time Investment**: ~45 minutes actual implementation

### Pattern Applied

**Transformation Pattern**:
```markdown
# BEFORE
**Modules**:
- processor.py (412 lines) - Thin orchestrator facade
- downloader.py (82 lines) - HTTP downloads
- tick_loader.py (67 lines) - CSV parsing

# AFTER
**Modules**:
- processor.py - Thin orchestrator facade coordinating 7 specialized modules
- downloader.py - HTTP download operations using httpx library
- tick_loader.py - CSV parsing returning pandas DataFrame
```

**Key Principle**: Replace volatile metrics with stable architecture descriptions

### Introspection System

**Created Makefile Commands**:
```makefile
make module-stats       # Current line counts (always accurate)
make module-complexity  # Cyclomatic complexity analysis (requires radon)
make module-deps        # Dependency tree (requires pipdeptree)
```

**Benefits**:
- Documentation never becomes stale
- Metrics always reflect current state
- Users can verify claims themselves

### Challenges Encountered

**Challenge 1**: Release notes and changelogs contain line counts

**Resolution**: Applied same principles to release notes. Line counts add no value even in historical records - architecture patterns are more meaningful.

**Challenge 2**: Deciding where to draw the line

**Resolution**: Simple rule - if it's a metric that changes with formatting, comments, or refactoring, don't document it.

**Challenge 3**: Making metrics discoverable without documenting them

**Resolution**: Created Makefile commands and documented the commands (not the metrics themselves).

### SLO Compliance

**Availability**: ✅ Raise on errors (no fallbacks)
- All edits used exact string matching
- No silent failures

**Correctness**: ✅ All line counts removed, introspection system working
- Verified with grep searches
- Tested `make module-stats` command

**Observability**: ✅ Clear audit trail
- All changes documented in this file
- Git commit will show exact diffs

**Maintainability**: ✅ Off-the-shelf tools
- Used Make (standard build tool)
- Used wc, radon, pipdeptree (industry-standard tools)
- No custom implementations

### Lessons Learned

1. **Release notes need same treatment as main docs** - Even historical records benefit from focusing on patterns over metrics

2. **Introspection commands are better than documentation** - `make module-stats` always shows current state, docs would become stale

3. **Architecture patterns are more stable than sizes** - "Facade pattern" won't change with formatting, "412 lines" will

4. **Consistency matters** - Removing line counts from some docs but not others creates confusion

5. **Time investment is minimal** - 45 minutes to update all docs prevents years of maintenance burden

### Validation Results

**User-Facing Docs Checked**:
- ✅ README.md (no line counts)
- ✅ examples/*.py (no line counts)
- ✅ CONTRIBUTING.md (no line counts)
- ✅ CLAUDE.md (line counts removed)
- ✅ docs/README.md (line counts removed)
- ✅ RELEASE_NOTES.md (line counts removed)
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md (line counts removed)

**Historical/Planning Docs Preserved**:
- docs/plans/*.md (validation reports, historical snapshots)
- docs/archive/*.md (archived specifications)
- docs/research/*.md (research findings)

**Rationale**: Planning and research docs are timestamped snapshots documenting specific states at specific times. They're not claiming current state.

### ROI Analysis

**Time Investment**: 45 minutes implementation + 20 minutes documentation = 65 minutes

**Annual Maintenance Saved**:
- No need to update line counts after refactoring (estimated 4x/year × 10 minutes = 40 minutes/year)
- No confusion from stale metrics (estimated 2x/year × 30 minutes debugging = 60 minutes/year)
- No documentation drift reports (estimated 1x/year × 60 minutes = 60 minutes/year)
- **Total Saved**: ~160 minutes/year

**Payback Period**: ~5 months

---

## Conclusion

**Key Takeaway**: Document **architecture and intent**, not **implementation metrics**

**Action Items**:

1. Remove all line count references from CLAUDE.md
2. Replace with architecture patterns and SLOs
3. Add `make module-stats` for on-demand introspection
4. Update documentation style guide

**Time Investment**: ~1 hour to fix current docs, prevents future maintenance burden

**ROI**: 78% of teams struggle with outdated docs - this prevents that problem entirely
